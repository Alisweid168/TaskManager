# Task Manager App üìù

## Overview

The **Task Manager App** is a simple **To-Do List** application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework (EF) Core**, and **PostgreSQL**. Users can create, update, and delete tasks.

## Features

- **Create** tasks
- **Update** tasks
- **Delete** tasks
- View tasks in a simple and clean interface

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core MVC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Entity Framework (EF) Core
- **Authentication**: None (public app for now)
- **UI**: Razor Views (for MVC)

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following tools:

- **.NET 6** or higher
- **PostgreSQL** installed locally or hosted (you can use services like ElephantSQL for a free cloud database)
- **Visual Studio Code** (or any code editor of your choice)
- **Node.js** (optional, for frontend related tasks)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alisweid168/TaskManager.git
cd task-manager-app
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to restore the project dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Configure Database Connection

Open the `appsettings.json` file and add your PostgreSQL connection string. It should look like this:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=myserver;Port=5432;Database=mydb;Username=myuser;Password=mypassword"
  }
}
```

Replace `myserver`, `mydb`, `myuser`, and `mypassword` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.

### 4. Set Up the Database

Run the following commands to create the database and apply migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the necessary tables (e.g., for tasks) in your PostgreSQL database.

### 5. Run the Application

Once everything is set up, run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to start using the Task Manager App.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can:

- **Create a new task** by filling out the form and clicking "Save".
- **Update a task** by editing an existing task and saving the changes.
- **Delete a task** by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
